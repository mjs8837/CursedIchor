# Project Postmortem

For a group that knew nothing about collaborating on a big project, we didn't do half bad.  Pineapple Pizza Inc. came out with a solid plan, with realistic expectations.
We had a few ideas that were definitely outside the scope based on the time we had to work on this project, but we figured out shortly after, that those things could not
be completed.  Despite making this game for a class project, it really was fun for the whole group, and everyone on the team enjoyed working with each other.  With our
game, we wanted to do something a little bit outside the box.  Pinapple Pizza Inc. wanted to create a typical hack and slash game, with a twist.  Our idea for a twist was
to add card mechanics that were equivalent to special abilities such as fireballs and meteors, or something like a healing ability.  With this idea, we were hoping to be
different than every other group that was also creating their own game.  We wanted to have a very unique look and feel to our game, and we wanted to have a good time while
making it.  Though it is different, there are many unique aspects to it, and there are many things that make it different from other things that are being made/ have 
already been made.
    
I think the biggest struggle Pinapple Pizza Inc. ran into was coming up with a name for the game.  There were plenty of ideas thrown out, but in the end, the name Cursed
Ichor was the right one.  Though there were other struggles, that was the biggest one.  Not even coming up with an idea was a tough task for our group.  On the first day
we were assigned the project we were all throwing out ideas, and came together very quickly with our unique idea.  As time progressed our idea became more and more
refined, until it eventually became what it is today.  Cursed Ichor went through plenty of changes throughout its production, almost all for the better.  As a group, we
have been working all the way up until the day of our final milestone, and there is definitely the possibility that the game is continued by anybody in the group in the
future.  We all have had fun with this, but now it's time to talk about what really matters.

**What Went Right**

**1. Unique Mechanincs**

Our biggest unique element was being able to use cards as unique abilites that the player could use whenever their mana did not go below the cost of the card.  Actually 
being able to implement our card mechanics successfully with the correct art was a big plus for us.  Considering monogame is not the best for UI aspects and things like
that, it was definitely a bit of a challenge for us to get it done correctly.  There was nothing but good feelings once we got it working within our game.  It was a
really relieving feeling, and it made the game so much better than it would have been otherwise.  The other unique part about the cards was being able to come up 
with a unique deck of cards.  Having that extra dimension in our game really helped everyone feel more immersed in the game.  Going into the project, we knew that 
getting the cards to work the way we wanted to would not be easy.  We knew it was going to take the whole group to try and figure out how it was going to work.
Overall, having a game with unique mechanics definitely made it a more enjoyable project, and definitely made it a bit more challenging.

**2. Getting Along Outstandingly**

Over the course of this project, we have definitely become much closer to each other as individuals, and have felt much more comfortable sharing our lives with each
as well as getting work done on the project.  At the beginning of this project we were all very quiet around each other, and weren't very open to breaking that shyness
early on.  Over time, that shyness became less and less apparent as we cracked jokes with and at each other, and shared stories of our pasts.  We really got to know each
other, and we all look forward to seeing each other in the future whether it be related to our game, our major, or anything else.  At this point in time, we really enjoy
talking to each other, and hopefully we can all find ways to stay close as this project comes to an end.  Throughout the course of this project, not once have any of us
been angry at each other or had any problems with each others personalities.  The comfort level between people has done nothing but increase, and friendships have been
developed, and hopefully will be kept for a long time to come.  

**3. Having Unique Assets**

For a while, our game had temporary assets, and at one point we were unsure if implementing our own art was very necessary.  But that was just us being over cautious.
Shortly after thinking this, our group had been able to create and implement the assets for the player, the enemies, the cards, the UI, and the backgrounds.  Having
our own created assets made the game feel more accomplished overall.  Borrowing sprites from another source was not the way we wanted to do it, and being able to
implement our own art also made the game feel more immersive.  Also having our own art made everyone feel more confident in our game overall, and made everyone else
think our game was more unique than it already was.  Despite not being able to have animations for everything under control, if the time permitted, we would have been
able to implement it, and the game would have had yet another different aspect to it.

**What Went Wrong**

**1. Use of Time**

As a group, we definitely were not the most effective with our time.  We often pushed off problems with our game until the day (or couple days before) each milestone and
would often spend hours in one session trying to figure out what needed to be done.  There was definitely plenty of time for us to all work on the game individually,
but we were not very good about it.  None of us were very good about getting work done well before deadlines, but we always did get our work done.  Despite this, for
any future assignments involving group work, we all know what not to do.  We all know not to wait until the last minute to complete higher difficulty tasks, and we
all know to refrain from rushing work in general after this project experience.  If we had balanced our limited time a bit better, we could have definitely had time
to implement more extra features and could have made the game more enjoyable for the player.

**2. Too Social**

A lot of times during our meetings, we would often socialize in order to get closer to each other, and in the end that really wasted some of our time during meetings.
Though it wasn't a bad thing all the time, it definitely limited our efficiency during team meetings, and in the end, our game wasn't the best it could be because of
that.  There were definitely things we could have sat down and fixed if we didn't spend as much time socializing.  With the time constraints we were given, there 
wasn't enough time to really get to know those in the group, and we tried to force that with each meeting we had.  The biggest reason for this was because outside of
class and meetings, none of us could really get together because of schedule conflicts.  Despite the problems being social caused, our game still ended up as a
finished product, and given more time, being social definitely would have been the right thing for us.

**What Did We Learn**

**1. Time efficiency**

Our biggest problem, as mentioned above was not being able to effectively use our time to make the game.  It always came down to the last minute for each milestone,
and we now know that's not a good habit to have when it comes to group work.  Having poor time efficiency is something that we don't want to carry into any other 
projects we do in the future whether it be together, or with other people.  It is also something we don't want to carry into our everyday college life either.  With 
poor use of time, we definitely did not get the best out that we could have, but we know better for the future.

**2. Find Other Occasions to Socialize**

Our other big problem, as mentioned above, was being too social in class and at team meetings.  This was something that we learned wasn't very good for actually getting
work done.  For any future projects, we know we need to find other times and places to socialize.  We know that socializing during our work time was not good for the
game, but we still did it anyway, and we know better for the future.  If not, socialize in different places, at least limit the amount of socializing to a minimum 
rather than talking each others ears off through a whole meeting.

**3. Lucky Group Placement**

This definitely isn't a problem we learned about, but it was a good thing for sure.  The group we got placed in was really lucky and we are all thankful for that.
We've all heard about groups in other sections that didn't get along the best, or had someone that didn't do their share of the work, and we realized that we don't
have either of those problems.  Having this group together was definitely something that went in our favor, and we really got work done (when we weren't socializing).
We all got along well, we all did work on the project, and we all had fun with this project!

**What We Would Do Different**

**1. Using Time More Efficiently**

There definitely was a problem with our time efficiency, especially since this is the third time we've mentioned it.  We all know that in the future, we need to be
able to balance our time between everything we have going on and spending time on the project.  We call it our biggest problem, but in all reality, it really wasn't
that big of a problem.  It was just something that we could have done better, and we know what using our time effectively can do for us.  

**2. Find Other Occasions to Socialize**

You may notice it says the same thing under "What Did We Learn", and that's because it does.  We learned that we should have found other time to socialize, but also
for future group projects, we would find other time to socialize.  Socializing is something that needs to be done throughout the time of a group project, but there is
a time and a place for it.  That time and place is not during class or team meetings.  It is something that needs to be done by going and doing things when everyone
is free, or when everyone wants to.  Overall, if there was more time for this project, we would have been fine the way we were, but considering there was such a time
constraint on our project, the way we went about things wasn't the most effective.  It is definitely something we will all keep in mind as we move on and do more 
group oriented work, and is something that everyone should keep in mind when trying to get work done.
