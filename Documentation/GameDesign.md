# Game Design

## Overview

### Genre
* Hack and Slash with card game elements for special abilities.

### Background Story
* You are a vampire hunter trying to kill dracula who will be the final boss.
* Vampire blood has healing properties which can be harvested to save the town from infection.
* The main character needs Dracula's blood to save the town.
* The time period will take place during the dark ages with steampunk elements.

### Objectives
* Save the town by killing Dracula, but in the mean time don't die from the hordes of vampires.

### Inspiration and References
* Kingdom Hearts RE: Chain of Memories
    * The card mechanics are pulled directly from this game.
* Dungeon Fighters
    * Our idea is to have a 2.5D game and the character movement and attack style is inspired by dungeon fighters.
* Castlevania
    * The overall look and feel of our game in terms of the design and story is heavily inspired by the vampire genred Castlevania.
* Slay the Spire
    * The actual implementation of the card mechanics will match the more clean and intuitive design of Slay the Spire.
* Binding of Isaac
    * The dark and gorey pixelated aspect is drawn from BoI.

## Game Play
* Attacking enemies with special abilities accessed through the cards.
* Mechanical arm that has a sword attached to the end.
* Mana energy system to deploy cards based on their mana cost.

### Novelty
There are very few real time games with card mechanics. Our group likes to think we're taking the best aspects of these games and 
combining them into something more unique. Vampires as a central aspect of a story in games does not seem to be as common anymore 
and that sort of game mixed with more rare elements like 2.5D and real time card mechanics make it a game worth trying.  
It's an experience unlike the others, but just as fun.

### Game Modes
* One mode where you can attack with a sword, or attack with special card abilities.
* Mode includes killing vampires until there are none left.

### Controls
* Movement occurs using the arrow keys.
* Main sword attack is done with space bar.
* Q, W, E are for the three card abilities.
* R is to shuffle the deck that the player is currently holding onto.

### Levels
* There are two total levels
    - The first is a level where you just go through and kill vampires until there are no more
    - The other is a boss level where you must fight dracula to complete the game.

### Player(s)
* It will be a one player game.

### Non-playable characters
* Many enemies will be spawned in the first level (hordes).
* Dracula boss with excess health.
* Townies in cut-scenes/endings. (Extra)
