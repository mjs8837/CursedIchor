# Milestones
_With each milestone, give a _brief_ (3-4 paragraphs at most) summary of what was accomplished during the milestone, any major lessons learned, and how your experience in that milestone influenced your plans for the next (or how you changed things during this milestone based on last time)._

## Milestone 1
As a group we came up with our game this milestone, first agreeing on a unique mechanic and then breaking down the story and design. 
All of us were very flexible and open minded. We built on each other's ideas, adding and tweaking with minimal conflict. 
We worked well and all disagreements were worked out in the end. 
Coming into the next milestones, we will tweak our game visually and mechanically as problems arise and ideas change. 
Our scope will likely expand as we complete the minimum components of our game. 
We've all learned who is best at what and how we can better work as a team using everyone's strengths.

So far, we're all on the same page and excited to get started on milestone 2!


## Milestone 2
From the time milestone 1 ended we were ready to get moving on coding our game. 
At first we were a bit ahead of ourselves, but since meeting in class with both Professor Mesh and Ben Hoffman, we learned exactly what we needed for milestone 2. 
Both before and during spring break we have been able to implement our ideas into code and get a basic feel for what will need to be done for future milestones. 
For milestone 2 the implementation hasn't been too challenging, and everyone has contributed to the game. 
The biggest lesson we have taken away is that we have continued to work well together as a group, and we will continue to work as efficiently as possible as future milestones approach.
Based on the time between milestone 1 and milestone 2, we have learned what we need to do better, and what we need to do in general to succeed.

Overall, working as a group has been effective for all of us up to this point, and we are looking forward to our game coming together!

## Milestone 3
This milestone taught us some of the challenges of coding creatively and many many more on debugging.
We faced a lot of bugs, but managed to move past them each time thankfully. 
Our game's most important features were finished by this milestone, but there's still more work to be done. 
As a group, we've made a working game with assets, collision detection, effective game states, card mechanics, and more.

## Milestone 4
There was not a whole lot to do for milestone 4.
Overall, our game has come together very well, and we have done a great job working together to get things working the way they needed to.
As a group, we fixed bugs, and made the game work almost to what we wanted when we started this project.
It has been a fun time working as a group, and it is sad that our time working together must come to an end.
Working together has taught us all many things we are going to need for the future, and has taught us how to work togther on a larger scale project.
We all hope that we work togther again at some point in the future, but if not we all enjoyed this project as a whole, and enjoyed the group we were given!
