## Instructions
The general guideline for a non-lecture PowerPoint slide is 5x5: _No more than 5 bullet points, no more than 5 words per bullet point._  The slide is there so the audience understands what you’ll be talking about.  It does not take the place of the speaker.  This means you should know what you’ll say during that slide.  

I suggest you practice in front of (at least) your team.  Actually present to yourselves and speak out loud so you understand the pacing and how each topics flows into the next.  

With each milestone, **add a link in the table above to your presentation slides** (I'm assuming these will be in Google Slides) AND **make a few notes in this document** about how you went about planning and practicing for this presentation. 

## Milestone 1
* We worked together to come up with the information that you see in the slides.
* Everything was agreed upon and worked out as a group.
* Later was reformatted by a group member to look more organized.
* We decided who was presenting and how on our last meeting before the milestone presentation.

## Milestone 2
* Because of how low maintenance this presentation was, we quickly put together a powerpoint for this milestone.
* We decided only two of us would go up to show our game and present our new developments.

## Milestone 3
* Like Milestone 2, we quickly put together a powerpoint that covered our new developments.
* It's simple and we're hoping to show most of our progress through our game.

## Milestone 4
* For our last milestone presentation, we quickly pu together a summary of our postmortem.
* There's not much to it, and it's a good way to wrap up the project as a whole.
